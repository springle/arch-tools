* Docker Environment

This directory contains the Docker environment for Architect
development. To get started, simply =cd= into this directory and
run =docker-compose up=. Note that you will need to have docker
and docker-compose installed. On some systems, all docker
commands must be prefaced with =sudo=.

Once the containers are running, you should have a local copy of
ElasticSearch, Neo4J, Kibana, and RabbitMQ. These can be accessed at
the following URLs:

- ElasticSearch: [[http://localhost:9200]]
- Neo4J: [[http://localhost:7474]]
- Kibana: [[http://localhost:5601]]
- RabbitMQ: [[http://localhost:15672]]

Note that on some systems (namely Windows) you will need to replace
localhost with the value of =docker-machine ip=. For those services
with authentication enabled, default usernames and passwords can be
viewed and edited inside [[file:docker-compose.yml][docker-compose.yml]].
