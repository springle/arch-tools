* Keystone Pipeline Preloader

The Keystone Pipeline pulls URLs from an exchange in RabbitMQ,
processes them, and outputs the results to a number of targets 
(Elasticsearch, Neo4j, etc). This preloader populates that exchange in
RabbitMQ, so the Keystone Pipeline can start working. To run with the
default settings, run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 preloader.py
#+END_SRC
